Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have started the implementation of the code, gathered pictures to use in the html pages, and researched helpful library's to use in the implementation
of the project

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not yet created an SQL database to store users, have not linked to harvardkey either, nor have I developed the ability to use profile pictures per the creation of the account.
As it stands, users can share to a news feed all with the same smileyface and stored simply using jinja. 
#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Will make sure to contact any obstacles to my section leader and probably join many upcoming tutorials in the next week.
