# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

CSfFiftybook

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Social Media website that acts as a social media ouutlet for CS50 Alumni and future students. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using Flask, python, Java, CSS, SQLite, and HTML... I will create a website that essentially acts as a facebook for CS50 students both current and prior.
Once you have registered and logged in, you can post updates (Job availablities, Personal stories, Coding Memes...), private message, and pages relating 
to CS50's great history and Alum. It can also include a list of historical landmarks in the course's history, include some guest lectures, and potentially
even a directory of photos to which you can dynamically upload and update. 

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TFs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The website is up and running, with the ability to Register, Log-in, post, and private message.  

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website is up and running, with the ability to Register, Log-in, post, and private message. Many pages about complementary CS50 info and files as well. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The website is up and running, with the ability to Register, Log-in, post, and private message. Many pages about complementary CS50 info and files as well.
Design is improved heavily and potentially more life-like features of face-book could be added. 


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will start researching what types of codes I might utilize and if there are any shortcuts. I will start with the flask-code required to register, log-in, ...etc as done
in finance. Then, I will gradually start adding features.
